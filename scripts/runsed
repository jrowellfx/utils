runsed is a wrapper for the command "sed -f sed.script [FILE]...".

runsed runs a script-file called "sed.script" (that must exist in the
current directory) on each FILE listed on the command line.

runsed changes the files in place, that is, it replaces the existing
FILE with a stream-edited copy of itself.

A backup copy of each original FILE is created called ".FILE.runsed" in the
directory that FILE resides.

Two special files are also created in the current directory to allow you
to review all the changes made as well as undo the changes if the results
weren't what you expected.  Namely, the files ".runsed.diff.runsed" and
".runsed.undo.runsed" which are executable.

When you are eventually satisfied simply remove all files called ".*.runsed"
with the command:
    rm .*.runsed

If you changed files in subdirectories, this is a better way to get rid
of all the crufty leftovers, plus it handles files with spaces in
their names properly:

    find . -name '.*.runsed' -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f

Ultimately it's up to you to clean up the crufty leftover files.

optional arguments:

 -h, --help      show this help and exit
 --version       print out the version number and exit
