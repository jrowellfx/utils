# utils
Some useful utilities.

ts - prints out a string suitable for a time stamp as YYMMDD-hhmmss.

modtstamp - adds or subtracts hours from a files timestamp, used to be
    useful when copying files across timezones, but possibly less
    useful these days.

tabs2spaces/spaces2tabs - is a wrapper for the commands expand and unexpand
    respectively.  The FILES are changed in place, and changes can easily
    be undone.
